1) 1. FAT Main Memory Requirements You already know that the main disadvantage of
FAT is, that the complete file allocation table has to be held in main memory all the time
to make it work. Assume a 250 GB disk and a 1 KB block size.
	(a) How many blocks does the disk have?
		250 GB = 250 *1024*1024 = 262 144 000 KB
	(b) How many entries must the FAT have?
		262 144 000 Entries
	(c) What size must be a table entry?
		log2(262 144 000) = 27,96→ 32Bit
	(d) Finally what size is the FAT now?
		32 Bit/8 * 262 144 000 = 1 048 576 000 Byte /1024/1024 = 1000MB
		
2. Random Access of Files Describe in detail how the access position 107834590 in the
following file systems.
	(a) UFS with a block size of 1 KB.
		Find the I-Node from the file. Then calculate the next block position:
		1) the next 10 Blocks are direct Blocks:
		2) single indirect block are calculated 1000/8 would equal 125 references to datablocks
		3) double indirect block block are calculated 1000*1000/8 would equal 125.000 to datablocks
		4) triple indirect block block are calculated 1000*1000*1000/8 would equal 125.000.000 to datablocks
		
	(b) FAT32 with a block size of 1 KB
		You get the first block-reference of the FAT by the file-name,
		then u have to jump 107.834.590 times within the FAT to get to the correct block.
	
3. (20 %) UFS (i-node) File Size What is the difference of the maximum file size in UFS
when using a block size of 4 KB compared to a block size of 1 KB. Assume 32 Bit block
numbers.

32 Bit zu 4 Byte
4 096 Byte / 4 = 1024  einträge möglich

ersten 10 eintägen:  * 4096 = 40960 Byte 

single direct pointer : 1024 * 4096 = 4194 304 Bytes 

double direct pointer: 1024 * 1024 * 4096 = 4294 967 296 Bytes double direct pointer

triple direct pointer: 1024 * 1024 * 1024 * 4 096 = 4 398 046 511 104 Bytes 

4. (20 %) UFS File Size You are currently using UFS with a block size of 512 bytes on the
system disk of your computer. Since you want to build up a multi-media library on an extra
hard disk and your experience with UFS was pretty good (stable, fast, etc.), you consider
to again use UFS as your file system. So you buy an external hard disk and have to choose
a proper block size for this. You estimate to have a maximum file size of around 5 GB.

(a) Will it be sufficient to keep a block size of 512 or do you have to take 1024 bytes?
Why?
512/4*512 = 65 536
512/4*512/4*512 = 8 388 608

1024/4*1024 = 262 144
1024/4*1024/ 4 * 1024 = 67 108 864

512 weil sich beim double indirect mehr files gehen 

(b) What would change if you estimate 12 GB as a max. file size of your multi-media files?
Why?

With an filesize of 512 Byte we need an triple indirect.
With 1024 we need an double indirect. 

1024 is better
